;;; Commentary:

;; Configure `tree-sitter' for some prog modes.
;; This module is very opinionated, I don't like tree sitter
;; highlighting in all modes.

;;; Code:

;; setup tree sitter

(u/use-package 'tree-sitter)
(u/use-package 'tree-sitter-langs)

(add-hook 'tree-sitter-after-on-hook #'tree-sitter-hl-mode)

(with-eval-after-load 'tree-sitter
  (require 'tree-sitter-langs))

;; add languages

(with-eval-after-load 'typescript-mode
  (add-to-list 'tree-sitter-major-mode-language-alist '(ts-react-mode . tsx)))

(with-eval-after-load 'js
  (add-to-list 'tree-sitter-major-mode-language-alist '(js-react-mode . tsx)))

;; activate tree sitter for some modes

(add-hook 'python-mode-hook #'tree-sitter-mode)
(add-hook 'js-mode-hook #'tree-sitter-mode)
(add-hook 'ts-mode-hook #'tree-sitter-mode)
(add-hook 'js-react-mode-hook #'tree-sitter-mode)
(add-hook 'ts-react-mode-hook #'tree-sitter-mode)
(add-hook 'terraform-mode-hook #'tree-sitter-mode)

(provide 'mod-tree-sitter)
