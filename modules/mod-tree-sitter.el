;;; Commentary:

;; Configure `tree-sitter' for some prog modes.
;; This module is very opinionated, I don't like tree sitter
;; highlighting in all modes.

;;; Code:

;; setup tree sitter

(use-package tree-sitter
  :hook ((python-mode js-mode ts-mode terraform-mode) . tree-sitter-mode)
  :config
  (add-hook 'tree-sitter-after-on-hook #'tree-sitter-hl-mode))

(use-package tree-sitter-langs
  :after tree-sitter)

(provide 'mod-tree-sitter)
;;; mod-tree-sitter.el ends here
