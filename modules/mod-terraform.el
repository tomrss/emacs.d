;; Support for Terraform development with `eglot', `tree-sitter' and
;; some useful helper functions.

;;; Code:

;;;; Setup language

(u/use-package 'terraform-mode)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.tf\\'" . terraform-mode))
(add-hook 'terraform-mode-hook #'eglot-ensure)
(add-hook 'terraform-mode-hook #'terraform-format-on-save-mode)
(add-hook 'terraform-mode-hook #'tree-sitter-mode)

;;;; Language server setup

(with-eval-after-load 'eglot
  (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs
               '(terraform-mode "terraform-ls" "serve")))

;;;; Helper functions

(defun u/terraform-command (command &optional interactive)
  "Execute Terrafom COMMAND.

If INTERACTIVE is non-nil, `comint-mode' will be used."
  (let ((default-directory (project-root (project-current t))))
    (compilation-start
     (concat "terraform " command)
     interactive
     (lambda (_) (format "*terraform: %s @ %s *" command default-directory)))))

(defun u/terraform-init ()
  "Terraform plan."
  (interactive)
  (u/terraform-command "init"))

(defun u/terraform-plan ()
  "Terraform plan."
  (interactive)
  (u/terraform-command "plan"))

(defun u/terraform-apply ()
