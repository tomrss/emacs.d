;;; Commentary:

;; Try to integrate Claude Code in Emacs

;;; Code:

;; install required inheritenv dependency:
(use-package inheritenv
  :straight (:type git :host github :repo "purcell/inheritenv"))

;; install claude-code.el, using :depth 1 to reduce download size:
(use-package claude-code
  :straight (:type git :host github :repo "stevemolitor/claude-code.el" :branch "main" :depth 1
                   :files ("*.el" (:exclude "images/*")))
  :bind-keymap
  ("C-c c" . claude-code-command-map) ;; or your preferred key
  ;; Optionally define a repeat map so that "M" will cycle thru Claude auto-accept/plan/confirm modes after invoking claude-code-cycle-mode / C-c M.
  :bind
  (:repeat-map my-claude-code-map ("M" . claude-code-cycle-mode))
  :config
  (claude-code-mode))

(provide 'mod-claude)
;;; mod-claude.el ends here
